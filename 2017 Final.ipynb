    "The CIA World Factbook (not Facebook, as autocorrect so often thinks) contains files of data gathered from countries all over the world throughout the years. The data represent certain characteristics of the countries such as GDP, Population, Area, etc., However, the CIA does not provide the factbook in the form of a nice and convenient CSV file, so I would like to convert the data from its human-readable format (as a webpage) to a Pandas friendly format, a CSV file. The goal of this project is to create an up-to-date version of the country data from 2000 to at least 2017 (There are factbooks for 2018 and 2019). In order to do so, I would like to scrape the data from the CIA factbook webpage. I will first download the factbooks from the website, find the necessary paths in my local disk drive, and create a cleaned CSV file that contains all of the columns that present characteristics of the countries around the world. \n",
    "\n",
    "The characteristics that I am interested in is the following:\n",
    " - Area: the area that a country covers\n",
    " - Birth rate: the rate of births per 1000 population\n",
    " - Climate: different types of weather a country experiences\n",
    " - Coastline: the length of the coastline of a country in kilometers (km)\n",
    " - Death rate: the rate of death cases per 1000 population\n",
    " - GDP - Composition by sector of origin (%): the GDP in the three sectors, agriculture, industry, and service, of a country\n",
    " - GDP - Purchasing Power Parity (in dollars)\n",
    " - Government type(s) of a country\n",
    " - Health expenditures (% of GDP): the percentage of the fund that is spent on healthcare\n",
    " - Infant mortality rate: deaths per 1000 live births\n",
    " - Inflation rate (%)\n",
    " - Internet Users (%): the percentage of the population that uses the internet \n",
    " - Land use: the distribution of land for different purposes\n",
    " - Literacy (total, male, and female) (%): the overall literacy rate, and the literacy rates in men and women of a country\n",
    " - Net migration rate (%): migrants per 1000 population\n",
    " - Population: the number of people who are currently living in a country"
